Hello,

This is a project to make a QR code you can scan and get a playable little JS game running on your phone/compatible device. I want to put this on stickers and sticker them in fun places.

Currently everything is within the file generateQR.py . Run this in Python, and if all works, you should see the QR code appear on screen.

The code within is specified within in the data variable. The image is saved to qr{timestamp}.png, and then displayed with feh.

Have fun!
